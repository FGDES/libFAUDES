HOA style serialisation for libFAUDES generators

(c) Thomas Moor 2025

======================================================================

To use a wide range of third party omega-automata tools, we implement
serialisation from and to the HOA file format.

Regarding output in HOA format, we somewhat adhoc iterte over states
and transition to write them to a std::ostream.

Reading input in HAO format is more involved. To this end, we use the
cpphoafparser library, authored/copyrighted by

them with libFAUDES under the same license terms.
