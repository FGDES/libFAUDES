HOA style serialisation for libFAUDES generators

(c) Thomas Moor 2025

======================================================================

To use a wide range of third party omega-automata tools, we implement
serialisation from and to the HOA file format.

Regarding output in HOA format, we somewhat adhoc iterate over states
and transition to write them to a std::ostream.

Reading input in HAO format is more involved. To this end, we use the
cpphoafparser library, authored/copyrighted by

oachim Klein <klein@tcs.inf.tu-dresden.de>
David Mueller <david.mueller@tcs.inf.tu-dresden.de>

We have found the original sources at

http://automata.tools/hoa/cpphoafparser

They are distributed under LGPL v2.1 conditions and we include
them with libFAUDES under the same license terms.

======================================================================

Status:

At this stage, we evaluate Safra determinisation. I.e.. we output
a non deterministic Buechi automaton to a HAO file, run the external
tool ltl2dstar for the actual determinisation, and read back the
resulting deterministic Rabin automaton. Thus:

1) writing NBA to HAO should work
2) reading DRA from HAO should work for implicit edges.

Anything else will probably not be functional.
