libFAUDES plug-in to provide some generic support for omega automata

As of 2025, we started to collect support for omega languages in this separate
plug-in. The rational is to prevent cluttering support for omega languages all
over other plug-ins. Thus, the collection of data structures and algorithms is
not restricted to libFAUDES use cases. Feel free to contribute.
