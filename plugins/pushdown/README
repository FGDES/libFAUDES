This libFAUDES plug-in synthesizes a minimally restrictive supervisor for a regular plant language (provided by a deterministic finite automaton (DFA)) and a context free specification language (provided by a deterministic pushdown automaton (DPDA)).
To run a tutoral provided in ./tutorial (e.g. pd_tutorial.cpp), run "make tutorial" and start the generated executeable by ./tutorial/pd_tutorial. To run the tutorial and both save the output to a file and display it in the terminal, use 
"./pd_tutorial ls -l 2>&1 | tee pd_tutorial.txt".

This is the second version of the pushdown-plugin, distributed with libFAUDES 2.25c in January 2015.
