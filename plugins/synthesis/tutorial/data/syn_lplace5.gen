"plant component place 5"

% place i takes bottles from place i-1
% by an r event, whenever place i-1 was 
% occupied; else, an r event frees place i
%
% thus, to record the status of place i,
% we track the status of place i-1 and r;
% since place i has no sensor itself,
% we make its status explicit by introducing
% oi (occupie) and fi (free) events.
%
% this generator is meant as a template and we
% use T (for this place) and P (for previous place)
% as oparameters.
