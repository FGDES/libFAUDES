8 Conveyor Belts, left to right transport, designed with hiosys-approach
------------------------------------------------------------------------
notation: wp=workpiece, cb=conveyor belt

  Table of events
  
*** timed physical conveyor belt model:
example: conveyor belt cb2 (with clock c2) situated between cb1 and cb3
actuators:
- cb2stp (stop belt movement)
- cb2-x, cb2+x (movement in positive/neg. x-direction)
sensor:
- cb2wpar, cb2wplv (positive/neg. sensor edge due to wp arrival/leaving resp.)
shared and unobservable events:
- cb1-2: wp crosses border between cb1 and cb2 moving from cb1 to cb2
- cb2-1, cb2-3, cb3-2: analogous

I/O models:
example: neighboured conveyor belts cbA (left) and cbB (right)

*** I/O plant model of cbA
- "A_r" +UP+        "A_l" +UP+         "A_stp" +UP+: belt movement (right,left,stop)
- "A_wait" +YP+: ready/waiting
- "A_full" +YP+:  wp at sensor (implied by cbAwpar)+
- "A_arrtl" +YP+: "arrive to left" - workpiece arrived at sensor left from cbA (e.g. on cb left from cbA)
- "A_arrtr" +YP+: "arrive to right" - workpiece arrived at sensor right from cbA (e.g. on cb right from cbA)
- "A_reqfl" +YE+: wp request from left
- "A_reqfr" +YE+: wp request from right
- "A_occfr" +YE+: received wp from right and cbA is now occupied
- "A_occfl" +YE+: received wp from right and cbA is now occupied
- "A_freetl" +YE+: released wp to the left and cbA is now empty
- "A_freetr" +YE+: released wp to the left and cbA is now empty
- "A_nack" +UE+: negative acknowledge
- "A_pack" +UE+: positive acknowledge

***  I/O plant model of cbB: replace "A_" by "B_"

*** specification for cbA, also +YC+ and +UC+ alphabet of I/O controller for cbA:
- "A_STP" +UP+: standby command
- "A_FL" +UP+: take wp from the left
- "A_TR" +UP+: deliver wp to the right
- "A_WAIT" +YP+: ready/waiting/done
- "A_FULL" +YP+: taking wp
- "A_ARRTR" +YP+: delivering wp to the right
- +YE+ +UE+: see plant model of cbA

*** I/O controller for cbA:
- +YC+: see +YP+ of specification for cbA
- +UC+: see +UP+ of specification for cbA

*** I/O environment of cbA and cbB
- +YE+/+UE+: see  I/O plant model of cbA and cbB
- "AB_occfl" +YL+: "occupied from left" - compound AB received wp and is now occupied
- "AB_accfl" +YL+: "accepted from left" - compound AB received wp (and can take futher wp's)
- "AB_freetr" +YL+: compound AB released wp to the right and is now free/empty
- "AB_reltr" +YL+: compound AB released wp to the right (and can release more wp's)
- "AB_reqfl" +YL+: wp request from left
- "AB_nack" +UL+: negative acknowledge
- "AB_pack" +UL+: positive acknowledge

*** specification for compound AB:
- "AB_FREE" +YP+: ready and empty
- "AB_FULL" +YP+: taking wp
- "AB_WAIT" +YP+: ready and neither empty nor full
- "AB_OCC" +YP+: ready and full
- "AB_ARRTR" +YP+: releasing wp to the right
- +YE+/+UE+: see +YL+/+UL+ in environment AB

All remaining events: analogous
