+ extension of the hio-state attributes by the additional flag "Err":
  with public read/write access in all hiogenerators, this
  flag enables to specify so-called "Error behaviour" that is
  typically entered after unexpected input events like invalid
  operator commands. The flag can be used by the model
  designer; the hio function FreeInput() uses this flag when
  extending a hio generator by error behaviour in order to make an
  input free in this generator. Err is not bound to any formal definition
  and does  not effect / can be combined with any of the remaining flags.
  Hence, Err remains untouched by the functions IsIoPlant(),
  IsIoController(), IsIoEnvironment(), IsIoConstraint() and
  UpdateStateAttributes().
