This tutorial illustrates the usage of the diagnosis plug-in.

-- diag_1_eventdiagnosis.cpp --
This first part demonstrates the diagnoser structure and the 
computation of a diagnoser from a given system and partition 
of its failure events.

-- diag_2_languagediagnosis.cpp --
The second part runs sample diagnosability tests for a given 
system with respect to a specification language, respectively.

-- diag_3_modular.cpp --
In this last part diagnosability of an overall system is calculated 
by verifying decentralized diagnosability for every subsystem with respect 
to local specifications.
